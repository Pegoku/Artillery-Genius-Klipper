## 10/29/2025 8 PM - Modify the printer frame  

I was given this 3D printer, due to the owner getting a better one.

I love klipper, and the easy to use WebUIs like Fluidd.
To mod this printer, I'll first have to modify the frame so I can access the SCB's IO.

## 10/29/2025 10 PM - Design a bracked for the SBC   

I designed a bracket so I could screw the SBC to the chassis of the printer. I did a quick design to test it. It mostly worked, though, I have to fix a few issues with the design/improvemes I can do.![089e156b-7141-488f-ac42-cf473aa09ce7~1](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjU0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--78a55fcf72badb6580587f539e2a7279aa69f6cf/089e156b-7141-488f-ac42-cf473aa09ce7~1.jpg)
