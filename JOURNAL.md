## 10/29/2025 8 PM - Modify the printer frame  

I was given this 3D printer, due to the owner getting a better one.

I love klipper, and the easy to use WebUIs like Fluidd.
To mod this printer, I'll first have to modify the frame so I can access the SCB's IO.

## 10/29/2025 10 PM - Design a bracked for the SBC   

I designed a bracket so I could screw the SBC to the chassis of the printer. I did a quick design to test it. It mostly worked, though, I have to fix a few issues with the design/improvemes I can do.![089e156b-7141-488f-ac42-cf473aa09ce7~1](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjU0OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--78a55fcf72badb6580587f539e2a7279aa69f6cf/089e156b-7141-488f-ac42-cf473aa09ce7~1.jpg)
  

## 10/31/2025 - The printer is assembled!  

I finished assembling the printer. It was hard to find the USB-B cable, but I luckily did. Sadly, it is a bit too long, and it touches the fan.

Final build:

## 11/1/2025 - Why is it to hard to flash firmware!  

I now just had to flash klipper to the MCU, and it seemed like an easy task, but... it wasn't (maybe I was just being ******).
It turns out the board used an ATmega2560, and you can't just flash them. you have to press the reset button, and less than a second later, start uploading the firmware, if not, it will just timeout. This took me a WHILE to figure out, after too much trial and error.
But finally! The printer is configured.
Sadly, the display doesn't work (yet), but the printer prints!

I also configured the firmware using the correct end stops (as I don't have a bltouch), leveling the bed, calibrating PID, etc.

The printer isn't extremely fast, but it's fast enough, roughly similar, though a bit slower than my current Elegoo N4.
